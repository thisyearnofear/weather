# 🌤️ Fourcast: AI-Powered Weather Edge Analytics on BNB Chain

**Built for BNB Chain Prediction Markets Hackathon**

An AI intelligence layer that analyzes weather forecasts to identify mispriced prediction markets. Uses BNB Chain for low-cost prediction receipts and performance tracking, while leveraging Polymarket's established liquidity for market data.

## 🎯 Core Value Proposition

Weather impacts billions in outcomes (sports performance, voter turnout, event logistics), but retail prediction market participants systematically under-weight these factors. Fourcast uses AI to detect information asymmetries where current odds don't reflect weather-adjusted probabilities.

## 🔗 Multi-Chain Architecture

### **Polymarket (Polygon) = Trading**
- Actual prediction market orders and settlements
- Established liquidity and professional trading infrastructure
- Order books, spreads, market depth

### **BNB Chain = Analytics & Receipts**
- Low-cost prediction receipts (<$0.10 per transaction)
- Fast finality (3-second blocks) for instant confirmation
- Immutable performance tracking and analytics storage
- Cross-chain prediction history

### **Why This Design?**
Rather than bootstrapping our own prediction markets (expensive, slow), we leverage the best of both chains:
- **Trade where liquidity exists** (Polymarket/Polygon)
- **Track where it's cheap** (BNB Chain)
- **Analyze across both** (unified dashboard)

This hybrid approach provides professional trading with affordable analytics—the best of both worlds.

See [Architecture Guide](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical details.

## 🚀 MVP Scope (No Model Training Required)

### What It Does

- Fetches upcoming events from Polymarket (sports games, marathons, outdoor events)
- Retrieves weather forecasts for event locations via WeatherAPI
- Queries Venice AI to analyze: "Given these weather conditions, do the current market odds reflect the weather impact?"
- Displays ranked opportunities with AI-generated explanations and confidence scores

### Key Features

- **Weather Context Engine**: Matches events to location forecasts (temp, precipitation, wind, humidity)
- **AI Analysis**: LLM evaluates team/participant climate adaptation, playing styles, historical performance in similar conditions
- **Edge Detection**: Compares AI-assessed probability vs. current Polymarket odds
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Shows full AI explanation for each flagged opportunity
- **Real-time Updates**: Monitors forecast changes and odds shifts

## 🔗 Integration with Existing Platform

Built as a new module within the existing Fourcast app:

- **Leverages existing**: WeatherAPI integration, Polymarket client, Next.js infrastructure
- **Adds new**: Event scraper, AI analysis engine, edge-finder UI dashboard
- **Extends markets from**: Weather-specific predictions → Weather-influenced event outcomes

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

Event Detection → Weather Fetch → AI Analysis → Edge Scoring → User Dashboard

### APIs Used
- WeatherAPI (already integrated)
- Polymarket API (already integrated)
- Venice AI API (new)
- Sports/Event APIs (ESPN, The Odds API)

### AI Prompt Pattern

Using Venice AI (qwen3-235b model for deep reasoning):

Analyze this event for weather-related edge:
- Event: [NFL game, marathon, etc.]
- Participants: [teams/athletes with home climates]
- Weather: [forecast details]
- Current Odds: [Polymarket probability]

Assess:
1. Does weather significantly favor one outcome?
2. Are odds efficiently priced or is there asymmetry?
3. Confidence: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH

Provide 2-3 paragraph analysis with specific reasoning.

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Do flagged edges materialize more than random?
- **User engagement**: Do users find analyses valuable?
- **Market validation**: Can we identify odds movements after weather forecasts update?
