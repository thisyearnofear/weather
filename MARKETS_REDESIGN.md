# Markets Page Redesign - Date-First UI

## Changes Made

### UI Redesign
- **Before**: Search-based filter (search for teams/locations)
- **After**: Date-based tabs showing upcoming events
  - Today
  - Tomorrow
  - This Week
  - Later

### State Changes
Removed:
- `sportsSearchText` / `setSportsSearchText`
- `sportsMaxDays` / `setSportsMaxDays`
- `includeFutures` / `setIncludeFutures`

Added:
- `selectedDateRange` / `setSelectedDateRange` - controls which time period to show

### API Changes
Date range maps to `maxDaysToResolution`:
- "today" → 1 day
- "tomorrow" → 2 days
- "this-week" → 7 days
- "later" → 60 days

## Debug Logging

Comprehensive logging added at multiple levels:

### Server-Side (`polymarketService.js`)
- `buildMarketCatalog()` logs API calls per sport/league
- Volume distribution analysis
- Event type extraction
- Final catalog statistics

### API Route (`/api/markets`)
- Incoming filters logged
- Result summary (count, error, cached status)

### Testing
Run these scripts to verify functionality:

```bash
# Test raw Polymarket API
node scripts/test-polymarket-api.js

# Test full markets flow (Today + Soccer)
node scripts/test-markets-flow.js
```

## Performance Impact

The date-first approach:
- ✅ Shows relevant markets immediately
- ✅ Reduces API burden (fewer markets to fetch/process)
- ✅ Better UX for prediction markets (users care about upcoming events)
- ✅ Natural progression (today → tomorrow → later)

## Known Issues

1. **Weather API Auth (403)**: Weather fetching fails in Node.js tests, but doesn't block market display. Falls back to demo data.
2. **Tailwind Config Warning**: CommonJS/ESM mismatch - cosmetic, doesn't affect functionality
3. **Keyv Version Mismatch**: Dependency issue - cosmetic, doesn't affect functionality

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Click "Today" tab - should show same-day soccer matches
- [ ] Click "Tomorrow" - should show next-day matches
- [ ] Click "This Week" - should show up to 7 days out
- [ ] Click "Later" - should show 8-60 days out
- [ ] Switch between sports (Soccer, NFL, F1)
- [ ] Adjust volume filters ($10k, $50k, $100k)
- [ ] Open browser console to see debug logs during fetch
